installing pdbproc from scratch

install eclipse C/C++ edition.
Add pydev.
Install anaconda - don't use appdata/local - messes with tensorflow script. I used users/<user>/anaconda3

Fire up conda power shell
Create pdbproc environment as follows:

Most of pdbproc does not need tensorflow. If you want to use the GPT protein functions then install tensorflow and uncomment the import lines in pdblib.y

In the base environment:

conda install mamba

conda create -n pdbproc tensorflow
This installs scipy and numpy via tensorflow, also this creates python 3.10 as of 4/10/23

otherwise use this line
 
if using pydev need python 3.10

conda create -n pdbproc python=3.10
conda activate pdbproc


requirements: 

mamba install -c conda-forge numpy scipy matplotlib networkx pyvista scikit-learn periodictable



cd main project source directory for eclipse

git clone https://github.com/cjforman/pdbproc.git pdbproc

conda develop "project source directory/pdbproc"
or just drop a .pth file into the pdbproc/env/Lib/site-packages folder

In eclipse:

Create new interpreter as follows:
window->preferences->pydev->interpreters 

select New

navigate to python for anaconda3/envs/pdbproc/python.exe

Apply and close

rename pdbproc python as interpreter. 

if using pydey need to use python 3.10

conda install -c conda-forge imp
